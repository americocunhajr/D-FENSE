## Dynamics for Epidemic Surveillance and Evaluation


**D-FENSE: Dynamics for Epidemic Surveillance and Evaluation** repository stores and shares data related to Dengue epidemics in Brazil. In addition to surveillance and climate data related to epidemics since 2010, the repository presents predictive models for dengue outbreaks in the country. This work seeks to address emerging demands for dengue monitoring and forecasting, contributing to detailed analysis and supporting decision-making in public health.
The objectives of this initiative include:

- Storing and organizing relevant data on dengue cases in Brazil;
- Building tools for clear and accessible visualization of dengue-related data;
- Developing mathematical models for reliable short-term dengue progression forecasting;
- Disseminating high-quality information to the interested public, aiding in the understanding and combating of dengue.
